<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Welcome to the World Wide Web</h3>

<p>The World Wide Web -- and let me be clear, here in my world, we still capitalize "Web," <a href="http://www.poynter.org/2016/ap-style-change-alert-dont-capitalize-internet-and-web-any-more/404664/">regardless of what the AP Stylebook says</a> -- was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. The Web is <a href="https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet">not the same</a> as the Internet -- although both should be capitalized, according to Audrey at least.</p>

<p>Here is how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_We">Wikipedia describes</a> the Web:</p>

<p><blockquote>The World Wide Web (WWW) is an information space where documents and other web resources are identified by URLs, interlinked by hypertext links, and can be accessed via the Internet. ...Web pages are primarily text documents formatted and annotated with Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). In addition to formatted text, web pages may contain images, video, and software components that are rendered in the user's web browser as coherent pages of multimedia content. Embedded hyperlinks permit users to navigate between web pages. Multiple web pages with a common theme, a common domain name, or both, may be called a website. Website content can largely be provided by the publisher, or interactive where users contribute content or the content depends upon the user or their actions. Websites may be mostly informative, primarily for entertainment, or largely for commercial purposes.</blockquote></p>

<p>There's a lot to unpack in that description -- in terms of vocabulary and ideology.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#vocabulary" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Web Vocabulary</h3>

<p>Although the Web, particularly when appended with "2.0," was supposed to usher in a new era of a readable, writable information space, there's a lot of vocabulary that obfuscates how the technologies that underpin the Web work. Here are a few definitions:</p>

<p><strong>Hypertext</strong>: In 1963, Ted Nelson coined the term "hypertext." Hypertext, which is one of the structural features of the Web, is text displayed online in which other texts can be accessed via "hyperlinks." <a href="http://www.xanadu.net/">Project Xanadu</a> is the name of Nelson's original hypertext project.</p>

<p><strong>HTML</strong>: HTML is short for Hypertext Markup Language, the standard markup language for the Web. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML">From the Wikipedia description</a>: "HTML allows images and other objects to be embedded and it can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as < img /> and < input /> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as < p >...< /p > surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page."</p>

<p><strong>CSS</strong>: CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is used to set the visual style of a website or page.</p>

<p><strong>HTTP</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Web Browser</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Client / Server</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>DNS</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>IP Address</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Web Host</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>URL</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Domain</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>Subdomain</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>TLD</strong>: TLD is short for Top Level Domain.</p>

<p><strong>LAMP Stack</strong>: LAMP is short for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. Although there are other technologies that can be substituted here -- Windows, for example, instead of the Linux operating system -- this has been for a long time the "stack" for running a website. That is, an operating system for the server, a database, and a programming language.</p>
